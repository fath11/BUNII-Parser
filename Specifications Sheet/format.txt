<element: {
Attribute: "Value1",
Attribute: "Value2",
Attribute: "Value3", ~This is a comment!~
intAttrib: 42, ~unlike html or xml, there can be other datatypes than strings!~
escaped literal: "^{Example!!^}", ~notice how whitespace doesnt matter in attribute names or anything? minimal forced whitespace!~
Nested example:{
     Nested1: "value1",
     Nested2: "value2",
     Nested3: "value3",
       NestArray: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,<another_node>
                                       </node_child/>
                                   </another_node>
                                   ]
     }

     @Repeat%4( ~This repeats these elements 4 times. it is quite useful for compression.~
         <Child element 1>
         if Attribute == "value1": ~python syntax for if-else, minus the forced indentation.~
            </Child element 2/>
         else:
             skip
         </Child element 1>
     )

</self-closed/> ~self-closed elements start and end with a "/".~

var1 = 5 ~Variables are contained to the location they are defined. if they are defined outside any node, they are global.~
    
<sibling element>
   </expression example:
       {
           attribute: 10
           ~you can use a single dollar sign followed by an attribute name to set a variable to that attribute.~
           var2 = $attribute
           ~Specifying 2 percentages before and after an attribute makes it globbal.
           %%globalattrib: 80%%
          
           ~ ".$" and "$." represent the start and end brackets of scripted expressions. ~
           calculated attrib: .$ (var1*var2) + 70 $.
           ~This attribute would return as 120.~
              
       }/>
</sibling element>

~lastly, if you wanna use raw data instead of attributes (like linking a json or xml file), use the "#" symbol in a tag.
All characters are escaped until it reaches a "</#Name here>". If you somehow need that as a literal, you can add an attribute titled "CUSTOMESC:" and whatever you put afterwards will be the new symbol to escape it.~

<#RAW DATA datatype: "Yaml" &CUSTOMESC&:"RAWDATAEND!">
--- # Sequencer protocols for Laser eye surgery
- step:  &id001                  # defines anchor label &id001
   instrument:      Lasik 2000
   pulseEnergy:     5.4
   pulseDuration:   12
   repetition:      1000
   spotSize:        1mm

RAWDATAEND! </#RAW DATA> ~ if you want to be extra organized, you can also put a tag after a custom escaped literal and it will work the same.~

~im sorry for bringing this into conception.~
